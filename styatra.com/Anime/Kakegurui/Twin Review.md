# Kakegurui Twin Review

![[kakegurui_twin_1.jpg]]

Okay, let’s rewind the clock. Before Jabami Yumeko walked into Hyakkaou Academy and turned it into a asylum for the criminally insane, there was Mary Saotome. _Kakegurui Twin_ is a prequel set one year before the main series, and honestly? It’s the breath of fresh air this franchise desperately needed.

Mary arrives at the academy as a transfer student on a scholarship. She isn’t some secret billionaire or a gambling addict (yet). She’s just a normal girl from a middle-class background who wants to study hard and succeed. But, because this is Hyakkaou, she immediately realizes that grades are trash and poker chips are god. On her very first day, she gets dragged into a gambling match, loses, and almost becomes a "House Pet."

But here is the difference: Mary doesn't get off on the risk. She gets angry. She looks at this corrupt, twisted system where rich kids buy human beings, and she decides she’s going to beat them at their own game. She starts clawing her way up the hierarchy, forming a crew, and getting targeted by the Student Council. It’s an underdog story in a world of monsters, and for the first time in this series, I actually care if the main character wins or loses.

## What to Expect

If you tune into _Kakegurui Twin_, expect the signature style: neon colors, jazz music, and enough sweat to fill a swimming pool. The visual identity is still very much _Kakegurui_.

However, expect a shift in tone. This isn't about the "thrill of madness." This is about **survival**. You can expect actual strategies that feel grounded (mostly), friendships that feel genuine, and villains who have motivations beyond just "I’m crazy, look at my scary face." It’s a tighter, more focused story that feels like a high-stakes heist movie rather than a fever dream. If the main series is a rollercoaster, _Twin_ is a high-speed car chase.

## A better protagonist

Let’s be real for a second. In the main series, Yumeko is fun to watch, but she’s a force of nature. She doesn’t have an arc; she’s just a natural disaster in a school uniform.

Mary Saotome, on the other hand, is a **character**. She is infinitely better as a lead. Why? Because she has everything Yumeko lacks: common sense and fear. Mary wants money. She wants status. She wants to prove that she—a "commoner"—is better than these stuck-up rich kids. She struggles. She sweats because she’s scared of losing, not because she’s turned on by it.

When Mary wins, it feels earned because we see her thinking. We see her panic. We see her improvise. She’s snarky, aggressive, and ambitious, but she’s grounded in a reality we can understand. She’s fighting for her life, not just for the lols, and that makes every card game hit harder.

## Everybody has a goal

One of my biggest gripes with the main show was that half the time, I didn't know _why_ anyone was doing anything. In _Twin_, the motivations are crystal clear, and it creates actual conflict.

![[kakegurui_twin_4.jpg]]

We have **Aoi Mibuomi**, the main antagonist here. He’s not just a generic villain; he’s running an insurrection. He wants to tear down Kirari Momobami’s student council. He sees Mary as a weapon he can use. Then you have **Sakura Miharutaki**, his fiancée. She isn’t just a prop; she wants to be a "noble" gambler and actually loves Aoi, but Aoi just sees her—and their marriage—as a political power move.

![[kakegurui_twin_6.jpg]]

And then there’s **Sachiko Juraku**, the sadist of the season. Her goal? She wants to break Mary and make her a pet. This puts her in direct conflict with her _current_ pet, **Mikura**, who is seething with jealousy.

Do you see the difference? Aoi wants power. Sakura wants honor. Sachiko wants ownership. Mikura wants validation. Mary wants freedom. These goals clash in every scene. It’s not just "let’s gamble because we’re bored." It’s a web of politics and relationships. For the first time, the drama outside the gambling table is actually as interesting as the game itself.

## A better pace

Speaking of games, _Twin_ handles the "power creep" of gambling so much better.

In the main series, they were betting their fingernails and their lives by episode two. It was 0 to 100 instantly. Here, the progression makes sense. We start with money. Then we move to debt. Then we move to reputation.

![[kakegurui_twin_5.jpg]]

Take the "Couples Game" (the dating treasure hunt arc). Was it confusing? Yes. I needed a flow chart to understand the rules. But the stakes were perfect. They introduced the risk of Mary having to "spend the night" with a guy she hates. It was creepy and tense, but they built up to it. They didn't just throw it out there for shock value in the first five minutes. By easing us into the risk, the 2-3 episode arc felt bearable. You actually felt the weight of the consequences because the show took the time to establish them.

## Good support

Finally, I have to talk about the supporting cast.

Mary actually has friends! Real ones! **Tsuzura** is the heart of the group—she’s sweet and loyal, the moral compass Mary needs. Then there’s **Yukimi**, the literary club member who brings the brains. Unlike Suzui in the main series, who is basically a glorified commentary track, these girls actually help. They contribute to the wins. Watching the three of them team up gives the show a "girl power" vibe that doesn’t feel forced.

Also, we get the rise of **Midari Ikishima**. Even in the prequel, she is consistently crazy. Seeing her origin—or at least, her earlier days—was a treat. She’s the chaos element that disrupts all the serious political plotting Aoi is trying to do.

And let’s go back to that word: **Insurrection**. I love that this season acknowledges that the "House Pet" system is messed up. Aoi’s group, the "Full Bloom" society, is actively trying to rebel. People are tired of being slaves because they lost a game of poker. Wow! Progress! It makes the world feel lived-in, rather than just a stage for Yumeko to dance on.

___

_Kakegurui Twin_ proves that this franchise works best when it has a human heart beating under all the madness. It’s sharp, it’s driven, and Mary Saotome is the queen we should have been following all along.
