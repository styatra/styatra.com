Imagine a high school where math and history are tossed in the trash, and the entire curriculum is just "how to develop a crippling gambling addiction." This is Hyakkaou Academy. The student body is a hive-mind of rich, sweaty idiots who bet millions on poker; if you lose, you become a "House Pet"—essentially a slave with a nametag.

## Should you watch it?

**Mixed**

Here is the deal: _Kakegurui_ is the definition of "style over substance." If you want neon colors, jazz music, and girls making terrifying "ahegao" faces while screaming about odds, you’ll have a blast. Visually, it’s a fever dream. But if you turn your brain on for even a second? It collapses. The main series (Season 1 and especially Season 2) suffers from convoluted games that need mid-episode tutorials, zero actual consequences for the main characters, and a male lead (Suzui) who is as useful as a screen door on a submarine. **However**, the prequel, _Kakegurui Twin_, is actually... good? It has character arcs, logic, and Mary Saotome, who is infinitely better than Yumeko. Watch the main show for the memes, watch _Twin_ for the story.

## You will also like

Well... Kakegurui is one of those anime that is difficult for me to place in a bucket. If you were here for the high stake games I would say that [[Death Parade]] might be a good anime for you. It has a better emotional core and has a gorgeous art. 

But let's face it: you were not here for "high stake games". You, as a fellow man of culture, were here for something else. And for that I could recommend either [[Prison School]] or [[Food Wars]]. Personally I think that the latter is a worst product overall (and too long to my liking), but both scratch that itch if you know what I mean.
