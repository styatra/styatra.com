# styatra: politically incorrect reviews

Why this place? I wanted a place to write about anime. Here it is. In the last few years I've basically just watched anime. Reason why is that feels like anime actually have new things to show. It feels like there's still for the most part the hunger to do something new. 

So I wanted a place where I can rant, vent and yap about the content that I consume.
